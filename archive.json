      "body": "I was wondering if we should include an optional hash of the related certificate.   That would constrain issuance order (as the hash of one of them would need to be known), but it would give you the guarantee that you got the right certificate and that someone didn't compromise the URL location.    So it would be an optional stronger binding.\r\n\r\nRelatedCertificateDescriptor ::= SEQUENCE {\r\n\t   uniformResourceIdentifier IA5String,\r\n\t   signatureAlgorithm \t[0] IMPLICIT AlgorithmIdentifier OPTIONAL,\r\n\t   publicKeyAlgorithm \t[1] IMPLICIT AlgorithmIdentifier OPTIONAL,\r\n           hashAlgorithmId      [2] IMPLICIT AlgorithmIdentifier OPTIONAL,\r\n           certHash             [3] IMPLICIT OCTET STRING OPTIONAL \r\n   }\r\n\r\nThe hashAlgorithmId would be the hashAlgorithm used for certHash.   The certHash would be the hash of the related certificate using the specified hashAlgorithmId.   It is optional and would be a useful check if it is there and would offer a strong binding in one direction (which is still better than weak two-way binding).\r\n\r\nExample UseCase...   PQ transition:    Issue ML-DSA certificate first with weak binding (no hash) to the location of a future traditional cert, then issue the Traditional RSA cert with this extension with the hash of the ML-DSA certificate.    Traditional software works fine.   When traditional software is upgraded the reference is used and hash verified.  If ML-DSA side needs to check traditional, it can still use the weaker (no hash) reference.   It could check that the traditional RSA has a reference including a hash of itself (but there would be no guarantee that a compromised traditional RSA certificate couldn't have just copied the public hash of the ML-DSA cert).   However this is not any weaker than what we are already proposing.\r\n\r\nAlternatively, we could change certhash into TBSCertificate hash which could allow strong two-way binding, but then we would have to remove the RelatedCertificateDescriptor extension from each of the TBSCertificates first before computing the hash which would strongly couple issuance.   I don't think we want this one.  \r\n\r\nSo I think adding a hash in one direction is straight forward and gives it a stronger property.   I think most use-cases would only use it in one direction anyway.\r\n",

No way to forward the proof.  Trusting the CA to make those statements.  \n\nSide coversation:  Attestation results - evidence and directly device measured itself.  Endorsements.  3rd party says something about you.  Eg..  This device is FIPS certified....  Evidence and Endorsements get verified.  They know how to read the data format.  Command line tool, verified under some policy.  Attestation results.  Example Boolean (pass/fail).  Attestation results simple output of the verifier.  Into an X509Verifier.\n\nIdea:\nUse the URL to point to another CRL - no transport security - Use Issuer and SerialNumber.   Gets rid of Chicken and egg problem of back and fourth hashing. \nProblem:  Does Publishing the serial number in advance of signing reduces the entropy if it is made public.  \n\nOpen Research Question\n - Use IssuerandSerialNumber for stronger binding or maybe instead use URL of its own publishing location.  That is probably easier to reserve\n - Question:  Can we invent a new unique identifier field? - borrow from ACME?  full of URL's - eg. ACME/NewOrder/UUID \n - SerialNumber+SKI? - Not supposed to be security relevant.  Use SKI as a kind of salt... \n - UUID_Discovery = HASH(SerialNumber+SKI)   or HASH(IssuerAndSerial)to obfuscate the SerialNumber. \n - UUID_DISCOVERY = HASH( .... some unique element(s) of cert ... )  \n    - Look at ACME - commitment to a cert existing in the future (URL Scheme)\n    - similar to how partitioned CRL's work (IDP checking)\n    - URL is in the certificate itself - cert now has wrong DCD ID.  Have to check they match and do a full 5280 validation.\n- Identifier for paired certificate - RFC 5697 draft\n   - Check if precedence of Hash or build off of previous work - \n   - Check RFC 5697 (Other certificates extension) - section 4",
