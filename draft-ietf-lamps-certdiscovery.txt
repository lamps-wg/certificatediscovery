              A Mechanism for X.509 Certificate Discovery
                 draft-ietf-lamps-certdiscovery-latest

Abstract

   This document specifies a method to discover a secondary X.509
   certificate associated with an X.509 certificate to enable efficient
   multi-certificate handling in protocols.  The objective is threefold:
   to enhance cryptographic agility, improve operational availability,
   and accommodate multi-key/certificate usage.  The proposed method
   aims to maximize compatibility with existing systems and is designed
   to be legacy-friendly, making it suitable for environments with a mix
   of legacy and new implementations.  It includes mechanisms to provide
   information about the target certificate's signature algorithm,
   public key algorithm and the location of the secondary X.509
   certificate, empowering relying parties to make informed decisions on
   whether to fetch the Secondary Certificate.

   The primary motivation for this method is to address the limitations
   of traditional certificate management approaches, which often lack
   flexibility, scalability, and seamless update capabilities.  By
   leveraging this mechanism, subscribers can achieve cryptographic
   agility by facilitating the transition between different algorithms
   or X.509 certificate types.  Operational redundancy is enhanced by
   enabling the use of backup certificates and minimizing the impact of
   Primary Certificate expiration or CA infrastructure failures.

   The approach ensures backward compatibility with existing systems and
   leverages established mechanisms, such as the subjectInfoAccess
   extension, to enable seamless integration.

1.  Introduction

   The efficient discovery of X.509 certificates play a critical role in
   modern cryptographic systems.  Traditional certificate management
   approaches often face challenges in terms of flexibility,
   scalability, and seamless updates.  To address these limitations,
   this document proposes a novel approach to certificate discovery
   utilizing the Subject Information Access extension within X.509
   certificates.

   The primary objective of this approach is to enable efficient multi-
   certificate handling in protocols, offering several key benefits.
   First, it enhances cryptographic agility by facilitating smooth
   transitions between different algorithms or X.509 certificate types.
   This is particularly valuable in scenarios where subscribers need to
   upgrade their cryptographic algorithms or adopt new certificate types
   while maintaining backward compatibility with existing systems.

   Second, the proposed method improves operational availability by
   introducing redundancy in certificate usage.  It enables the use of
   secondary certificates that can serve as backups, ensuring seamless
   continuity of services even in the event of Primary Certificate
   expiration or disruptions in the CA infrastructure.

   Finally, the approach accommodates multi-key/certificate usage,
   allowing for a relying party to obtain certificates to perform
   cryptographic operations that are not certified by a single
   certificate.

   The proposed method is designed to maximize compatibility with
   existing systems, including legacy implementations.  It leverages the
   subjectInfoAccess extension, which is already established in X.509
   certificates, and does not require modifications to the referring
   certificates.  This ensures ease of adoption and avoids disruptions
   to current certificate management practices.

   The following sections outline the details of the proposed approach,
   including the structure of the SIA extension, the modes of operation,
   and the considerations for secure implementation and deployment.

   By leveraging the capabilities of the SIA extension for certificate
   discovery, organizations can enhance cryptographic agility, improve
   operational availability, and accommodate complex multi-key/
   certificate scenarios, leading to more secure and resilient
   cryptographic systems.

1.1.  Use Case 1: Algorithm Agility

   The first use case is improving algorithm agility.  For example, the
   Primary Certificate uses a widely adopted cryptographic algorithm
   while the Secondary Certificate uses the algorithm that is new and
   not widely adopted yet.  The relying party will be presented with the
   opportunity to try the new algorithms and certificate types.  This
   will be particularly useful when transitioning from one algorithm to
   another or to a new certificate/credential type.

   In addition, the server may look at the logs to determine how ready
   the client side is to shift to completely rollover to the new
   algorithm.  This allows the subscriber to gather the metrics
   necessary to make an informed decision on the best timing to do an
   algorithm rollover without relying on third parties or security
   researchers.  This is particularly useful for PKIs that have a wide
   array of client software and requires careful consideration.

1.2.  Use Case 2: Operational Redundancy

   The second use case is where the Primary and Secondary Certificate
   adopts the same cryptographic algorithms but for instance, uses
   certificates issued by two different CAs or two certificates that
   have different validity periods.  The Secondary Certificate may be
   used as a backup certificate in case the Primary Certificate validity
   is about to expire.

   A common issue is when the intermediate CA certificate expires, and
   the subscriber forgets to update the intermediate CA configured on
   the server.  Similar to when some software collects the parent
   certificate through authorityInfoAccess CA Issuer access method when
   the intermediate certificate is absent, the peer certificate can be
   obtained.

   Due to increased adoption of the ACME protocol, the burden of
   maintaining the availability of a service is shifted to the CA
   issuance infrastructure and the availability would be dependent on
   the CA infrastructure.  To increase the operational redundancy, this
   mechanism can be used to point to another set of certificates that
   are independent from the Primary Certificate to minimize the chance
   of a failed transaction.

1.3.  Use Case 3: Dual Use

   The third use case is where one certificate is used by the named
   subject for a particular cryptographic operation and a relying party
   wishes to obtain the public key of the named subject for a different
   cryptographic operation.  For example, the recipient of an email
   message which was signed using a key that is certified by a single
   use signing S/MIME certificate may wish to send an encrypted email to
   the sender.  In this case, the recipient will need the sender's
   public key used for encryption.  A pointer to the named subject's
   encryption certificate will permit the recipient to send an encrypted
   reply.

2.  Conventions and Definitions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

2.1.  Definitions

   For conciseness, this section defines several terms that are
   frequently used throughout this specification.

   Primary Certificate: The X.509 certificate that has the
   subjectInfoAccess extension with the certDiscovery accessMethod
   pointing to a Secondary Certificate.

   Secondary Certificate: The X.509 certificate that is referenced by
   the Primary Certificate in the subjectInfoAccess extension
   certDiscovery accessMethod.  This certificate may also have a
   reference to the Primary Certificate in the subjectInfoAccess
   extension.

3.  Certificate Discovery Access Method

   This document specifies the new certDiscovery access method for X.509
   Subject Information Access (SIA) extension defined in [RFC5280].

   The syntax of subject information access extension syntax is repeated
   here for convenience:

      SubjectInfoAccessSyntax  ::=
              SEQUENCE SIZE (1..MAX) OF AccessDescription

      AccessDescription  ::=  SEQUENCE {
              accessMethod          OBJECT IDENTIFIER,
              accessLocation        GeneralName  }

   This document defines a new access method id-ad-certDiscovery which
   is an OBJECT IDENTIFIER that indicates the accessMethod is for
   certificate discovery.

   id-ad-certDiscovery OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= { id-ad TBD }

   The 'accessLocation' is a GeneralName otherName type as defined in
   [RFC5280].  Recall that the otherName type is defined as AnotherName:

   AnotherName ::= SEQUENCE {
        type-id    OBJECT IDENTIFIER,
        value      [0] EXPLICIT ANY DEFINED BY type-id }

   Which this document defines as:

-- Other Name OID Arc --
id-on OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= { id-pkix 8 }

-- Certificate Discovery Access Descriptor --
id-on-relatedCertificateDescriptor OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= { id-on TBD }

on-RelatedCertificateDescriptor OTHER-NAME ::= {
      RelatedCertificateDescriptor IDENTIFIED BY id-on-relatedCertificateDescriptor
   }

   Where id-on-relatedCertificateDescriptor is the OBJECT IDENTIFIER
   (type-id) and the value is RelatedCertificateDescriptor

   RelatedCertificateDescriptor is defined as follows:

    RelatedCertificateDescriptor ::= SEQUENCE {
      method CertDiscoveryMethod,
      purpose DiscoveryPurposeId OPTIONAL,
      signatureAlgorithm [0] IMPLICIT AlgorithmIdentifier OPTIONAL,
      publicKeyAlgorithm [1] IMPLICIT AlgorithmIdentifier OPTIONAL
   }

   RelatedCertificateDescriptor is composed of 4 components which are
   defined below.

3.1.  CertDiscoveryMethod

   CertDiscoveryMethod is defined by the following:

   CertDiscoveryMethod ::= CHOICE {
     byUri [0] IMPLICIT CertLocation
     byInclusion Certificate,
     byLocalPolicy NULL
   }

   CertDiscoveryMethod is the only required field of
   RelatedCertificateDescriptor.  It describes how the related
   certificate can be retrieved.

   There are three methods:

   1.  The byUri method provides a location where the related
       certificate can be retrieved.  The syntax of CertLocation is
       described below.

   2.  The byInclusion method encodes the DER encoding of the related
       certificate directly.

   3.  The byLocalPolicy method signals that the related certificate is
       available in a repository that is usable by the application
       consuming the certificate.

3.2.  CertLocation

   CertLocation is defined by the following:

   CertLocation ::= SEQUENCE {
      uri IA5String,
      certHash [0] IMPLICIT CertHash OPTIONAL
   }

   The certificate is referenced by an IA5String that contains the URI
   of the Secondary Certificate.  The DER encoding of the Secondary
   Certificate MUST be available at the specified location.

   CertLocation MAY include an optional certHash value which can be used
   to include a cryptographic hash of the DER Encoded Secondary
   Certificate.  The syntax of CertHash is described below.

3.3.  CertHash

   CertHash is defined by the following:

   CertHash ::= SEQUENCE {
      value OCTET STRING,
      -- TODO Add IssuerAndSerialNumber?
      hashAlgorithm AlgorithmIdentifier DEFAULT {algorithm sha-256}
   }

   certHash is defined as a SEQUENCE containing the OCTET STRING value
   which is the hash of the DER Encoded reference certificate as well as
   the hashAlgorithm, which contains the AlgorithmIdentifier for the
   chosen Hash value.  All implementations MUST support SHA-256 via id-
   sha256, and other hash functions MAY be supported.

3.4.  DiscoveryPurposeId

   DiscoveryPurposeId provides optional information to describe the
   purpose of including the discovery information for the related
   certificate.

   Currently, the following purpose identifiers are defined:

    -- Purpose OBJECT IDENTIFIER
   id-rcd-agility OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::=
                                  {id-rcd 1}

   id-rcd-redundancy OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::=
                                  {id-rcd 2}

   id-rcd-dual OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::=
                                  {id-rcd 3}

   id-rcd-priv-key-stmt OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::=
                                  {id-rcd 4}

   id-rcd-self OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::=
                                  {id-rcd 5}

3.4.1.  Algorithm Agility

   This purpose indicates the referenced certificate's purpose is to
   provide algorithm agility; i.e. the two certificates will use
   different cryptographic algorithms for the same key operations.  The
   two certificates SHOULD be equivalent except for cryptographic
   algorithm; i.e. the key usages SHOULD match.

3.4.2.  Redundancy

   This purpose indicates the referenced certificate's purpose is to
   provide operational redundancy; i.e. the Secondary Certificate could
   be issued by a different CA or has a different validity period which
   can be used as a backup if the Primary set of certificates is about
   to expire.

3.4.3.  Dual Usage

   This purpose indicates the referenced certificate's purpose is for
   dual usage; i.e. the related certificates belong to the same entity
   and one provides a signing-type key while the other provides an
   encryption-type key.  The two certificates SHOULD have matching
   identifiers.

3.4.4.  Statement of Possession of a Private Key

   This purpose indicates that the Primary Certificate did not not do a
   full proof-of-possession at enrollment time, but instead it provided
   a statement of possession as per
   [I-D.ietf-lamps-private-key-stmt-attr] signed by the Secondary
   Certificate.

   The reason for carrying a RelatedCertificateDescriptor of this type
   is to track that the Primary Certificate had a trust dependency on
   the Secondary Certificate at the time of issuance and that presumably
   the two private keys are co-located on the same key storage.
   Therefore if one certificate is revoked, they SHOULD both be revoked.

3.4.5.  Self reference

   This purpose indicates the Uniform Resource Identifier where this
   certificate is located.  Applications which retrieve this certificate
   can then compare the retrieved certificate with this value to ensure
   that the correct certificate was retrieved.

   This purpose can be used to bind the subjects of Primary and
   Secondary Certificates.  The Primary Certificate contains a self-
   reference to its location, as well as a reference to the Secondary
   Certificate.  The Secondary Certificate contains a self-reference to
   its location, and a reference to the Primary Certificate.  Provided
   that policy requires subject equivalence when this mechanism is used,
   then the consuming application can treat both certificates as
   certifying the same entity.

3.5.  Signature Algorithm and Public Key Algorithm fields

   The signatureAlgorithm is used to indicate the signature algorithm
   used in the Secondary Certificate and is an optional field.  The
   publicKeyAlgorithm indicates the public key algorithm used in the
   Secondary Certificate and is an optional field.

   When the validation of the Primary Certificate fails, the software
   that understands the SIA extension and the certDiscovery access
   method uses the information to determine whether to fetch the
   Secondary Certificate.  The software will look at the
   signatureAlgorithm and publicKeyAlgorithm to determine whether the
   Secondary Certificate has the signature algorithm and certificate
   public key algorithm it can process.  If the software understands the
   signature algorithm and certificate public key algorithm, the
   software fetches the certificate from the URI specified in the
   relatedCertificateLocation and attempts another validation.
   Otherwise, the validation simply fails.

   The semantics of other id-ad-certDiscovery accessLocation name forms
   are not defined.

   Note: For a description of uniformResourceIdentifier consult section
   4.2.2.1 of [!RFC5280].

4.  Security Considerations

   Retrieval of the Secondary Certificate is not sufficient to consider
   the Secondary Certificate trustworthy.  The certification path
   validation algorithm as defined in section 6 of [RFC5280] MUST be
   performed for the Secondary Certificate.

   The use of the self-reference purpose can be used to provide a
   subject binding between the Primary and Secondary Certificates.
   However, the procedure for validating subject equivalence MUST be
   defined by policy.  As a result, validation of subject equivalence is
   out of scope of this document.

   The Secondary Certificate may also have the certDiscovery access
   method.  In order to avoid cyclic loops or infinite chaining, the
   validator should be mindful of how many fetching attempts it allows
   in one validation.

   The same security considerations for caIssuers access method outlined
   in [RFC5280] applies to the certDiscovery access method.  In order to
   avoid recursive certificate validations which involve online
   revocation checking, untrusted transport protocols (such as plaintext
   HTTP) are commonly used for serving certificate files.  While the use
   of such protocols avoids issues with recursive certification path
   validations and associated online revocation checking, it also
   enables an attacker to tamper with data and perform substitution
   attacks.  Clients fetching certificates using the mechanism specified
   in this document MUST treat downloaded certificate data as untrusted
   and perform requisite checks to ensure that the downloaded data is
   not malicious.
